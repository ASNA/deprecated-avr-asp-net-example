## Very basis AVR for .NET ASP.NET example

This is an old (how old? It uses absolute-positioned controls. Don't do this!) AVR for .NET example that has a customer list and customer update page.

We strongly recommend that you don't use absolute-positioned controls now, but this example still has some merit. It shows the basics of hand-written list and update IO logic. 

Chapters 6 and 7 in the ClassBook.pdf in this repo cover, in detail, most of the logic presented here.
